Euler path is a path , that visits each edge exactly once. 
Euler cycle (circuit) is a closed Euler path. It begins and ends with the same vertex.
Eulerian graph : A graph that contains euler cycle. 
Semi - Eulerian Graph : A graph that contains euler path

Condition : All vertices with non-zeo degree should be connceted.

# Euler path : When 0 or exactly 2 vertices have odd degree.
# Euler Circuit : When all verties have even degree.

Fleury's algorithm for euler path or cylce : 
-------------------------------------------

if isEulerian() == false 
  print("not eulerian")

v = first odd degree vertex or any random vertex with even degree 

printEuler(v) : 
 
  for every child of v : 
    if((isValidNextEdge(v,child)) 
       print(v-child)
      removeEdge(v,child)
    printEuler(child)

bool isValidNextEdge(v,child):

return true if :
1. If child id the only adjacent vertex 
2. If there are multiple adjacents and edge  v - child is not a bridge .
