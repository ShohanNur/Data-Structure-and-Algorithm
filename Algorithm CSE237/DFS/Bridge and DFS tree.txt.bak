Bridge : 
A bridge is defined as an edge which when removed makes graph disconnected
or more precisely it increases the number of connected components.

DFS Tree : 
When we remove all back edges from a graph then we find a DFS tree of that
graph . 
A back edge can not be a bridge , because removing back edge from a graph, 
then number of connected components in graph will not increase.
