Bipartite graph :

Definition : 
Bipartite graph also known as Bigraph special graph such that one can divide the vertex into 2 disjoint sets such that : 
1. Each vertex belongs to exactly one of the 2 sets .
2. Each edge connects vertices of 2 different sets . 

A = {1,3,5}
B = {2,4,6}
Example :
1---2
3---4  
5---6

Approach : 
---------
First we start a dfs call from a node , mark it as visit , and set the color of the node as 1 . then traverse all of it's adjecent node and set color correspodingly such that adjacent two nodes have different color, 0 or 1. 
If we find same color in adjacent two nodes then it will not be a bipartite graph. 

source code :
------------
int c = 1;
bool dfs(int node,int c){
      vis[node] = 1;
      color[node] =1;
   
       for(auto child:graph[node]){

          if(!vis[child]){
              if(dfs(child,c^1)==false){
                return false;
              }
           }
          else{
            if(color[child]==color[node]{
             return false;
          }
      }
   return true;
}



***if the graph contains a cycle of odd lenghth then it is not a bipartite graph
