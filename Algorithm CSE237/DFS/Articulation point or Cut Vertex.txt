Articulation Points : 
====================
An articulation point (or Cut Vertex) is a vertex which when removed makes
the graph disconnected or more precisely it increases the number of the 
connected components.

If a node is a articulation point , when we remove it we actullay remove all
the edges incident to the node and hence the number of connected components
increases.

Relation between Bridges and articulation point :
================================================
1. End-point of a bridge will be an articulation point if that node has
degree at least 2.
2. It is not necessary of an articulation point to be an end-point of a 
bridge.
3. Finding bridges algorithm can not be used to find articulation point .
