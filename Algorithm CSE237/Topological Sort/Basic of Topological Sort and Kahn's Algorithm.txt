A topological ordering is an ordering of the noddes in a directed
graph where for each directed edge from A to node B , node A appears before node B in the ordering .

Kahn's algorithm is a simple topological sort algorithm can find a topogical ordering in O(V+E) time!

N.B: Topological orderings are NOT unique.

Only certain types of graphs have a topological orderings. These are Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs).

Kahn's Algorithm Intuition : 
---------------------------
The intuition behind Kahn's algorithm is to repeatedly remove nodes without any dependencies from the graph and add them to the topological ordering.
As nodes without dependencies (any their outgoing edges) are removed from the graph, new nodes without dependencies should become free. 
We repeat removing nodes without dependencies from the graph until all nodes are processed, or a cycle is discovered.

Process :
========
Add all nodes with a indegree of 0 (no incomong edges) to the queue. 
These are all the nodes in the graph with no dependencies. 
Then remove one node from the queue to the topological ordering and decreases indegrees of all affected nodes adjecent to it. 
If indegree of any node becomes zero now, we added it in the top of the queue.  
Repeat the process until the queue is finally empty and indegree of each node becomes zero.
